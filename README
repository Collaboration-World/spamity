Installation
===============================================================================

1. Creation of the database

1.1 Tables

Spamity requires only one table. It's recommended to create a specific database
for Spamity and a unique user to access its data.

If you expect the number of blocked messages to be large with respect to the
power/load of your database server, you can ask Spamity to use multiple tables.
To do so, set the parameter 'tables_count' to a reasonable number in your
configuration file. 

Once you have properly modified the configuration file spamity.conf (see 
sections 2 and 3 of this document), run the script "create_tables.pl". It will 
create one or many tables in your database. See the first lines of this script 
for more information.

1.2 Maintenance

You probably don't want to keep your quarantine to grow forever. You should 
define a daily cronjob to run the script "spamity_maintenance_sql.pl". This 
script accepts as argument the number of days to keep in the quarantine.

1.3 Web Sessions

If you install the web interface, you can also store web sessions in the
database. To do so, you must create an additionnal table defined in the file
sessions.psql (for PostgreSQL) or in the file sessions.mysql (for MySQL).
If you already use CGI::Session for another web application and want to use
the same table, make sure to add the column 'sid' (see the mentioned files).
Notice that the table definition for PostgreSQL varies depending on the version
of CGI::Session you have installed.

1.4 AMaViSd-new

As of version 0.8.0, Spamity's web interface provides access to AMaViSd-new's
custom users policies, and white/black lists. However, tables must be defined 
in the same database as Spamity.


2. Configuration and installation of the daemon

2.1 Perl Modules

The following Perl modules must be installed. You can easily install the
missing modules locally and specify the installation path in the daemon
script (see comments in sbin/spamityd).

  Compress::Zlib
  DBI
  DBD::Pg or DBD::mysql

And these additionnal modules if you want to use the LDAP backend for
users/addresses lookups:

  Net::LDAP

All modules are available at http://search.cpan.org/. For RedHat distributions,
most modules are available as RPM packages at http://dag.wieers.com/packages/.

The included module Spamity.pm along with the Spamity directory should also
be accesssible by the daemon. To know where Perl looks for available modules,
execute the following command:

% perl -le 'print join("\n",@INC)'

If you installed the modules at a non-standard path, look for the following line 
at the begining of the daemon script:

# use lib "/opt/spamity/lib";

Modify this line according to your modules directory path and uncomment it.

2.2 Daemon

The daemon must be executed by a user who can read the mail server log files.
You should make sure the script can only be read and execute by this user. The
variables defined in spamity.conf must be changed according to your
installation and the file must be moved under /etc.

The daemon accepts various arguments. Execute it with the argument "--help" for
more information.

2.3 Log Rotation

If your mail log files are periodically rotated, you must make sure to alert
the daemon when the rotation occurs. To do so, you should add a line similar
to the following to your logrotate script :

/bin/kill -HUP `cat /var/run/spamityd.pid 2> /dev/null` 2> /dev/null || true

2.4 Init Script

Some init scripts are available in the directory init.d:
  init.d/spamityd.lsb: Linux Standard Base version, works well under Debian
                       (including Ubuntu) and latest version of RHEL.
  init.d/spamityd.rh: works with distros that uses chkconfig, like all
                      RedHat variants (including RHEL).
  init.d/spamityd.unix: simple yet efficient version, should work under
                        most UN*X variants (tested under Solaris 9).

3. Configuration and installation of the web interface

3.1 Perl Modules

The following Perl modules must be installed.

  CGI::Session
  Template
  GD::TextUtil
  GD::Graph
  DBI

Depending on your configuration, install these additionnal modules:

  DBD::Pg (when using PostgreSQL)
  DBD::mysql (when using MySQL)
  Mail::IMAPClient (when using IMAP backend for authentication)
  Net::LDAP (when using LDAP backend for authentication and/or lookups)
  Mail::Internet (when allowing reinjection)

All modules are available at http://search.cpan.org/. For RedHat distributions,
most modules are available as RPM packages at http://dag.wieers.com/packages/.

You can easily install the missing modules locally and specify the installation
path in the CGI scripts (login.cgi, stats.cgi, search.cgi, help.cgi, and 
graph.cgi). Look for the following line at the begining of each CGI script:

# use lib "/opt/spamity/lib";

Modify this line according to your modules directory path and uncomment it.

Alternatively, you can also set PERL5LIB in your Apache configuration. Put this 
in a Directory block or .htaccess file:

  SetEnvIf  Request_URI  "^/cgi-bin/" PERL5LIB=/opt/spamity/lib

This will add the correct paths to PERL5LIB whenever someone accesses your 
cgi-bin directory.

Install the module Spamity.pm along with the Spamity directory in a place
accessible by the CGI scripts or as for the external modules, modify the CGI
scripts or your Apache configuration.

3.2 CGI scripts and static files

The static files (located under htdocs) must be accessible by your web server.
The CGI scripts (located under cgi-bin) must be accessible and executable by 
your web server. Modify the configuration parameters "cgibin_path" and 
"htdocs_path" with respect to the location of those files.

3.3 Configuration

The variables defined in spamity.conf must be changed according to your
installation and the file must be moved under /etc.
